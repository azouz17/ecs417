Now complete the statements below for each level you wish to be marked. Replace all text in square brackets.

LEVEL ONE

My code demonstrates inheritance in the following way...

I have a superclass called [character]

This superclass is extended into at least two subclasses called [wizard, archer,Antman,hitman]

For each of the named subclasses complete the following...

Subclass 1.

Subclass [wizard] extends the superclass by adding at least one property and its getters and setters. The name(s) of the added properties are [Boolean heal and int values for different attacks( tree_root, avadacadabra,fire_attack) .]

These/this new properties/property are used by the subclass in the following way: [heal(line 75, line 43) is used in the upgrade_attack method and determines if the attack avadacabra can heal the character.The different int values are used to decrease enemy health: (tree_root line 58)(fire_attack line 28) (avadacadabra 41,42,76,77).]

Subclass [wizard] extends the superclass by overriding the following methods (there must be atleast one): [get_attacks:68 attack2:39 upgrade_attack:72.]

These overridden methods are used in the working code in the following places: [class play: lines(85,118,108) respectivley.]

Subclass 2.

Subclass [Antman] extends the superclass by adding at least one property and its getters and setters. The name(s) of the added properties are [Boolean shock and different int values for attacks (electric_shock, go_Superlarge, flying_clothesline.]

These/this new properties/property are used by the subclass in the following way: [shock(lines 72,83) is used to determine if the electric shock attack will stun the enemy. The int values are used to decrease enemy health in different ammounts:(electric_shock 55,62)(go_SuperLarge line 24)(flying_clothesline 37 42 76 77).]

Subclass [Antman] extends the superclass by overriding the following methods (there must be atleast one): [attack3: line47  get_attacks: line 66 upgrade_attack:line70.]

These overridden methods are used in the working code in the following places: [class play: 119 85 108 respectivley.]


LEVEL TWO

Polymorphism consists of the use of the Substitution principle and Late Dynamic binding.

In my code, polymorphism is implemented in at least two placesâ€¦

Example 1.

The substitution principle can be seen in use in [class play lines: 55,60,65,70]. The name of the superclass used this example is [character] and the subclasses used are [Antman,wizard,archer,hitman].

Late dynamic binding can be seen in [class play lines: either 55,60,65,70 depending on the user answer].

[The user needs to choose a character for him to play with. So a variable of type character is declared in the begining of the code and then there are a series of if and else if statments
to determine what instance will the variable be of eg character c = new wizard(). Each character has special features and attacks]

Example 2.

The substitution principle can be seen in use in [class play lines:95,98]. The name of the superclass used this example is [enemy] and the subclasses used are [goblin, golem].

Late dynamic binding can be seen in [class play lines either: 95,98 depending on the random number that is generated].

[There needs to be an  enemy in each battle the user enters. So a varaible of type enemy is declared in the begining of the code so each battle has a different type of enemy who has different features and attacks]
